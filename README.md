## General Description

This repository contains the totality of the projects developed in the Kreativstorm **Python Development Hands on Training Program**. The program focused on providing students with real enterprise problems in order to train the habilities of problem solving in an algorithmic ways and usage of the programming language Python 3. The projects are the following:

### Hangman Game
This project is focused on the implementation of a Hangman Game as the title suggest. The game itself contains the basic logic using data structures, however it implements aditional features like:

- Clear the console when the game starts and finishes, independend of the Operating System
- Use **random-word-api** from herokuapp.com to prompt a word of certain lenght

### Email Automation
Email automation project is inspired in a real world problem faced by the Kreativstorm team, where they needed sends daily reports to clients via email.The main objective is to create a python script that automate the process.

For this specific project we used **SMTP protocol** and a **gmail recipient**. The project includes:

- Usage of smtplib python library to connect to the email server and send the emails
- Compose email by a configuration *.json* file
- Usage of *os* library to acces the reports or files required for the email
- Usage of *schedule* library to run daily at a specific time

The following features and the overall configuration of the project is shown in this diagram:
